# Buddy picker

Aim is to create a way for streamers to select members of the community to
  play games with. (Pseudo) random selection is a fair way but odds can always
  be shifted in favor of special (read: paying) members.

## TODO
- bug fixes :D
- better youtube membership confirmation (through chat)
- twitch subscriber confirmation (chat and/or auth)
- group control

Try locally
```
npm i
ng build
node server
```
Navigate (by default) to `localhost:4200`
